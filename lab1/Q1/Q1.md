## 1)
The last digit of my student ID is **2**. Put it into the content of x3014 as input and after running the program, I observe that the output (the content of x3015) is **0**.
## 2)
Looking at the program, we can find that the backbone of the program adds the results of the previous two iterations together as the result of the new iteration. So we know that the purpose of this program is to compute the Fibonacci sequence.
## 3)
There are some bugs:

1. When registers are initialized, the contents of the registers are affected by the contents before the initialization;
2. When the input is 0, 1, 2, all the output is 0, which does not meet the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.

The modified assembly language code is as follows:
```lc3
	    .ORIG	x3000
	    LEA	R1, INPUT
	    AND	R2, R2, #0
	    AND	R3, R3, #0
	    ADD	R3, R3, #1
	    ADD	R4, R3, #0
	    AND	R5, R5, #0
	    LDR	R1, R1, #0
	    BRNZ   	PRINT
LOOP	NOT    	R6, R1
	    ADD   	R6, R6, #1
	    ADD    	R6, R6, R5
	    BRZ   	PRINT
	    ADD    	R4, R2, R3
	    ADD    	R5, R5, #1
	    ADD    	R2, R3, #0
	    ADD    	R3, R4, #0
	    BRNZP  	LOOP
PRINT	STI    	R4, AD
	    TRAP   	x25
AD	    .FILL	x3015
INPUT	.FILL	#2
OUTPUT	.FILL	#0
	    .END
```
