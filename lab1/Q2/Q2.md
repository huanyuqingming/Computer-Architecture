Shifting a binary number ```b``` to the right **n** bits is equivalent to:
1. Make the binary number ```b``` reversed, then we can get a reversed binary number ```rb```;
2. Shift the reversed binary number ```rb``` to the left **n** bits;
3. Reverse the reversed binary number ```rb``` after the left translation to get the final result.

To reverse ```b```, we can use a mask ```b1000000000000000``` to get the top digit of ```b``` and put it into the last digit. Then we do ```b = b + b``` to shift ```b``` to the left, use the mask to get the second digit and put it into the penultimate digit. We repeat it until ```b``` has been reversed.

To shift the reversed binary number ```rb``` to the left **n** bits, we just need to ```rb = rb + rb``` **n** times.

Finally, we use the same method to reverse the reversed binary number ```rb```. So we get the result of shifting a binary number ```b``` to the right **n** bits.
